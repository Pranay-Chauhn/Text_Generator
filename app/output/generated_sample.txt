In the year 2135, Earth had become silent. The oceans had dried, and the skies no longer held stars. But beneath the ruins of an old observatory, something had just begun to stir..
the sun was rising in a great circle around us; but at that instant we saw it rise again from its ashes into our own! A tremendous light appeared before me as though my eyes were filled with darkness: yet there remained none near where i stood on earth until now when suddenly all seemed blackened by this flash which took place behind some trees within ten feet distance.  my heart sank like mad for ever after seeing such sights appear so soon since they first began their ascent towards heaven (and perhaps even beyond).  
 i looked

Prompt: hello world

hello world.
he said, with a smile of satisfaction: ive been living there for some time now; i can hardly believe that it has not done you good to be here since the morning yesterday evening! oh dear heavens indeed have he come so soon as we all knew his arrival was imminent and should never let him go again till our fathers were dead before dawn on sunday next week ; but no more is needed from me than this news will tell us what shall happen after dinner tomorrow night if any one or two persons are found alive in my family which cannot support them without foodand drinki am sure they do nothing except live under fear lest their own families perish at your hands unless such an event happensin case anyone finds out who knows

Prompt: hello world

hello world.
i shall not forget you; i am sure it will be a pleasure to see all my friends and family again! ive no doubt of your being in love with me, but what would the happiest thing have happened? (sighing.) do that which is most agreeable for this age: why then should we begin our marriage at once before mr. darcy leaves us out so much as possible without having her consent broken by any other woman whom she has never known or seen herself married except myself who always sees him alone when he comes home from his business abroad if anything happens on account thereof either now nor hereafter yet dear miss bennet de bourgh was born there two weeks ago while lydia had been engaged

Prompt: hello world

hello world, i am so sorry!
i know that you will not forgive me; but if your dear sister should have been happy to see him again soon enough she would be glad. ive heard the tale of how he was once taken prisoner in a madrassa and tortured with it until they could no longer find their way out from behind some trees or any other place where there were many devils lurking around them: now we must go on for our lives as though nothing had ever happened before hereabouts." mrs bennet looked at his companion anxiously while her eyes wandered over these words which seemed almost like whispering into each earl's ears when speaking firstly aloud then suddenly shut up all thought except hers alone (and indeed

Prompt: hello world

hello world, i wonder how many things you have to do for your children!
i can hardly believe it. ive been waiting a long time on the day when my father would come here; but now that he has arrived in town we are all ready and will go out together as soon thenas possible: there is no need of talking about anything else till mr. darcy returns from his visit at dinner this evening with her daughter (she does not wish him ill), since she knows very well what jane must be doing after so much trouble last night." said elizabeths aunt hastily before saying more than one sentence upon them both or any other subject which might provoke such an answer againfrom their conversation afterwardsabout three hours had

Prompt: Once upon a time

Once upon a time, when the gods had been formed for this purpose and were being taught to prepare them by their own knowledge.
but it was not long before they began in earnest work of creating those whom he would name as his chosen servants; while these men performed many occupations which made him an object worthy of admiration among all mankind who watched with rapt attention through that period during whose history so great has its importance such wonders have taken place! And now at last did we find our dear friend darcy himself again alive?

besides what you said about her having remained silent on any subject till after she died (and i do think there are some others) but if anything else is more curious than how often one speaks from memory concerning your

Prompt: hello ama

hello ama i know what you mean?
yes, he replied.  i have been speaking of myself for some time now; but when the conversation was over we parted at last in silence and took leave together with mr bingley to take care that they were not separated by long distance from their former dwelling house before evening had passed away: as soon afterwards it came about after breakfast my wife called into her room a little while ago asking if she should go out again tomorrow morning or on foot (she did), saying nothing more than this till then there appeared no further use being made so far northward! jane thought ill herself very much obliged hereto find something agreeable which would give them all pleasure indeedand therefore went off home

Prompt: hello ama

hello ama!
she answered, and walked towards the door.

elizabeth looked at her with a great deal of surprise; but when she entered it was in its most comfortable state to be found sitting by herself on one side while walking around as if talking very little or nothing about anything else: for there were many books upon which they had read several hours before them being interrupted only because eliza did not like reading aloud again after dinner so much that evening (i mean everybody) thought all those things would have been better left out altogether.)and then suddenly an idea struck jane too eagerly whether anyhow i should prefer mr bennet more than usual?the young woman replied no such thing could come easily enough from me lately either

Prompt: hello

hello, i am sure you will.
you have said so many things to me which were never meant for this lady; but she has been very kind and generous in giving them all away with the greatest kindness! ive no reason of remorse or resentment towards her though we may dislike each other deeply if they should be disagreeable (i do not know how much there is between us).her character must therefore remain as it was before when illbourn arrived at my house a fortnight ago: however he would certainly approve your application on every occasion except those that are particularly desirable only because one wishes his fortune more than another person does himself who wants wealth betterment by being able nowto live comfortably here without ever going abroad againas wellwith regard toward

Prompt: hi

hi, and the two brothers had been together for five years; but they were all very much on different sides.
the young man who was now at home in her house with him said nothing of it to me until he heard that she went upstairs one morning when a stranger came up from behind some bushes near his cottage which led towards its entrance: this time there appeared to be no sign as far forward or away nor any other visible signs than those made by others within view so suddenly approaching!  this surprised them both more because i thought what might have happened before would not seem improbable after such an appearance like these (and their neighbours also did think something strange). elizabeth then inquired about darcy being here again till sunday evening ;
